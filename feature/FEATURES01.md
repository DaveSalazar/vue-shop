Project Overview - 
1. The sites https://burgerpandabc.com.ua/ and https://burgerpanda.com.ua/, lets you order the food items like burger, salad, cool drinks and other add-ons. 
2. The other site https://sushipandabc.com.ua/, lets you order sushi sets and sushi.

Good things
1. Site has user friendly UI.

Issues
1. Top header is overlapping with the content.
2. Captcha question is always same.

Nice to have
1. This site should support category/filters/pagination so that when type of items goes large it will be easy for user to choose.
2. When quantity of product is selected as 0, button goes RED at the same time we can show error message like "please select quantity".
3. When we do not select any item but clicks on order we can show error message like "cart is empty".
